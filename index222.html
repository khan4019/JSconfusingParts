			<h2>Bad</h2>
			Strange type coercision and overloading of +
Strange results for equality testing == or ===, != and !==
Prototypal inheritance vs. class based object orientation
Noisy syntax, lots of curly braces, function keywords, and semicolons
Global variables are as easy a missing a var statement
Lack of any sort of design aesthetic
Lots of bad javascript progammers (think graphic designers)
Lots of bad javascript code (think code that a graphic designer would write)
Hundreds of implementations for every browser, version and other javascript dependent platform (and yes, some of them are buggy)

<h3>Good</h3>
Awesomely dynamic (basically you can do anything you want, type safety and common sense be damned)
Top-notch functional programming
Largest community of developers
Largest install base on the planet
No corporate ownership of the standard
Sophisticated javascript runtimes (most modern browsers, node.js etc)
